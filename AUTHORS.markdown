pycheddar was started by Jason Ford in January 2010. At that point is was just
a simple wrapper for CheddarGetter. Luke Sneeringer re-built it almost from
the ground up to make it object-oriented and to abstract the API even further.

The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

* Luke Sneeringer (all the bad ass stuff)
* Jason Ford (mostly moral support)

Let us know if you are interested in contributing to make pycheddar even better.
